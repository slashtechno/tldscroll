  long_description: "Ever see a long message or a thread you don't feel like reading through? Too Long; Didn't Scroll (TL;DS) allows you to summarize a message with the message shortcuts `Generate summary` and `Generate public summary`, in addition to the `/tlds` command.\r

    Summarizing, by default, will send an ephemeral message only visible to you. Alternatively, a public summary will result in a message being sent as a reply to the message."
